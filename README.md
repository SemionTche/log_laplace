# laplace_log

A **small, opinionated logging helper** built on top of Python’s standard `logging` module.

`laplace_log` is designed for **multi-module / multi-process scientific or application projects** where you want:

- One **central logger initialization**
- Logs from **your app + third‑party libraries**
- Clear **application names** in logs (e.g. `laplace.opt`)
- Automatic **daily log folders**
- Simple `log.info(...)` usage everywhere
- `print()` statements captured into logs

No magic, no external dependencies — just structured, predictable logging.

---

## Features

- ✅ Root logger configuration (captures library logs)
- ✅ Application‑named logger (`app_name`)
- ✅ File + console handlers with independent levels
- ✅ Automatic folder structure: `logs/YYYY-MM-DD/app_name.log`
- ✅ `print()` and `stderr` redirection into logs
- ✅ Simple `log.info(...)` helper available everywhere
- ✅ Singleton design (initialize once, use everywhere)

---

## Installation

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install laplace-log
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the logger **once** (entry point)

```python
from laplace_log.log_lhc import LoggerLHC, log

LoggerLHC(
    app_name="laplace.opt",
    file_level="debug",
    console_level="info",
)

log.info("Starting OptWindow...")
```

### 2. Use logging anywhere

```python
from laplace_log.log_lhc import log

log.debug("Debug message")
log.info("Information")
log.warning("Something looks odd")
log.error("Something went wrong")
```

No need to pass logger instances around.

---

## Log Output Example

```text
2026-01-20 10:21:47 [INFO] [laplace.opt] Starting OptWindow...
2026-01-20 10:21:48 [WARNING] [numpy] overflow encountered in exp
2026-01-20 10:21:49 [INFO] [root] A print statement
```

- **App logs** use your `app_name`
- **Library logs** keep their original logger names
- **print() statements** appear as `root`

---

## Folder Structure

```text
logs/
└── 2026-01-20/
    └── laplace_opt.log
```

- A new folder is created **each day**
- Dots in `app_name` are replaced by underscores for filenames

---

## Design Overview

### Root logger

The **root logger** is configured with:

- File handler (persistent logs)
- Console handler (stdout)

This ensures **all third‑party libraries** are captured automatically.

### Application logger

Each app uses its own named logger:

```python
logging.getLogger("laplace.opt")
```

This name appears in log records and helps identify the source clearly.

---

## The `log` Helper

`log` is a lightweight helper object:

```python
from laplace_log.log_lhc import log
log.info("Hello")
```

Internally, it forwards calls to the initialized `LoggerLHC` instance.

If logging is used **before initialization**, an explicit error is raised:

```text
RuntimeError: Logger not initialized! Call LoggerLHC(app_name, ...) first.
```

This avoids silent failures.

---

## Print Redirection

All `print()` and `sys.stderr` output is redirected:

- Printed normally to the console
- Also logged at `INFO` level via the root logger

This is useful for:

- Legacy code
- Debug prints
- Third‑party libraries using `print`

---

## Configuration Options

```python
LoggerLHC(
    app_name: str,
    log_root: Path | str | None = None,
    file_level: str = "debug",
    console_level: str = "info",
)
```

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `app_name` | Logical name of your application (`laplace.opt`, `lapalce.server`, …) |
| `log_root` | Base folder for logs (default: current working directory) |
| `file_level` | Minimum level written to file |
| `console_level` | Minimum level printed to console |

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Scientific applications (optimization, simulations)
- Multi‑process systems (master / worker / optimizer)
- GUI + backend projects
- Long‑running experiments
- Any project needing **clean, centralized logs**
